# 🧠 LLM-Powered Sentiment Analysis & Hyperparameter Optimization

This project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be combined with traditional Machine Learning to build explainable AI solutions using **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** and **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)** reasoning techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project consists of two tasks:

### 📌 Task 1: Sentiment Analysis using Chain-of-Thought

Developed a Streamlit-based application that uses **Groq Llama 3.3 70B** to analyze customer reviews and classify them as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

The model follows a structured reasoning process to:

* Identify positive sentiment phrases
* Identify negative sentiment phrases
* Detect mixed or contradictory opinions
* Determine the final sentiment label
* Provide a clear explanation for the prediction

This approach improves transparency by showing *why* a review was classified into a particular sentiment category.

### 📌 Task 2: Hyperparameter Optimization using Tree-of-Thought

Built a Machine Learning pipeline for **AQI prediction** using a **Random Forest Regressor** and performed hyperparameter tuning with **RandomizedSearchCV**.

The tuning results were exported and analyzed using an LLM guided by **Tree-of-Thought reasoning**, enabling the model to:

* Compare multiple hyperparameter configurations
* Evaluate performance metrics and ranking scores
* Analyze bias-variance tradeoffs
* Consider training time and model stability
* Eliminate weaker configurations
* Recommend the best-performing model with justification
